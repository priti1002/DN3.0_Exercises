1.Understand Asymptotic Notation:

Q.Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.
Ans.
Big O notation is a powerful tool used in computer science to describe the time complexity or space complexity of algorithms. It provides a standardized way to compare the efficiency of different algorithms in terms of their worst-case performance. Understanding Big O notation is essential for analyzing and designing efficient algorithms.

Q.Q.Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.
Ans.
1.Best Case: The minimum time an algorithm takes to complete, usually when the desired element is found at the first position. For example, O(1) for linear search if the element is the first item.
2.Average Case: The expected time an algorithm takes to complete over all possible inputs. For example, O(n/2) for linear search, as it may need to check half of the elements on average.
3.Worst Case: The maximum time an algorithm takes to complete, usually when the desired element is not found, or is the last element. For example, O(n) for linear search when the element is not in the array.

4. Analysis

Q.Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.
Ans.
Time complexity of linear search algorithms=>

Best Case:𝑂(1)- The target element is at the beginning of the list.
Average Case:𝑂(n)- The target element is in the middle or the list needs to be fully traversed.
Worst Case:𝑂(n)- The target element is at the end of the list or not present in the list at all.

Time complexity of binary  search algorithms=>

Best Case:𝑂(1)- The target element is at the middle of the list.
Average Case:𝑂(logn)- The list is divided in half each time, resulting in a logarithmic time complexity.
Worst Case:𝑂(logn)- The target element is not found after continuously halving the list until no elements are left.


Q.Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why?
=> Binary Search is more suitable for the e-commerce platform due to its logarithmic time complexity, making it significantly faster for large datasets. However, it requires the array to be sorted. If the product data changes frequently, maintaining a sorted array might add overhead, but the performance gain in search operations justifies it for platforms with a large number of products.
Linear Search is simpler and does not require a sorted array, but its linear time complexity makes it less efficient for large datasets.
