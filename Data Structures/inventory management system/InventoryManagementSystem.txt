1.Understand the Problem

Q.Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.

Ans. 
1.Efficient Data Storage and Retrieval- Choosing the right data structure (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, hash tables) allows for efficient storage and retrieval of inventory items. For example, a hash table can provide constant-time complexity for insertions and lookups, which is crucial for large inventories.
        Example: Using a hash table to store inventory items by their unique IDs allows for quick access and updates.

2. Fast Search and Query Operations- Implementing efficient search algorithms (e.g., binary search, hash-based search) reduces the time required to find specific items in the inventory.
        Example: Binary search on a sorted array can locate an item in logarithmic time, making it much faster than a linear search on a large list.

3.Managing Dynamic Data- Dynamic data structures like linked lists, dynamic arrays, and balanced trees (e.g., AVL trees, Red-Black trees) can grow and shrink as needed, providing flexibility in managing inventories that change frequently.
        Example: A dynamic array can automatically resize itself when new items are added, maintaining efficient access and modification times.


Q.Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
Ans.
1.ArrayList: Provides dynamic array capabilities, allowing for efficient random access and easy resizing.
2.HashMap: Offers constant time complexity for insertion, deletion, and look-up operations, making it ideal for inventory management.
3.TreeMap: Maintains sorted order of keys and allows for efficient range queries and ordered operations.

4. Analysis

Q.Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.
Ans.
1.Add Product: O(1) - Insertion in a HashMap is generally constant time.
2.Update Product: O(1) - Updating a value in a HashMap is also constant time.
3.Delete Product: O(1) - Removing an entry from a HashMap is constant time.

Q.Discuss how you can optimize these operations.
Ans.
1.Batch Processing: For bulk updates or inserts, consider batch processing to reduce the overhead of multiple individual operations.
2.Indexing: If search operations on non-key attributes (e.g., productName) become frequent, consider adding indexing mechanisms or secondary data structures to support faster lookups.
